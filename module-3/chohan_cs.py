In this traditional Japanese dice game, two dice are rolled in a bamboo
cup by the dealer sitting on the floor. The player must guess if the
dice total to an even (cho) or odd (han) number.
If the dice total number results in two(NI) or a seven (NANA) then the player will receive a bonus of ten additional mon.
